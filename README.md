# Inverse_Design_of_Polymers
Inverse Design of Polymers via Evolutionary Algorithm and Bayesian optimization
## Description
we propose a robust machine learning workflow for the inverse design of high thermal conductivity (TC) polymers. Our work starts from a computational database containing 1144 polymers with known TCs. Using those data, we construct a surrogate deep neural network model for TC calculation and extract a polymer-unit library with 32 sequences. Two state-of-the-art algorithms of unified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (U-NSGA-III) and q-noisy expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI) are employed for sequence-controlled polymer design. They are the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm, respectively, since the synthesizability of the emerging polymers is also evaluated using the synthetic accessibility score. The approach proposed is flexible and universal, and can be extended to the design of polymers with other property targets. Please refer to our work "Machine learning-assisted inverse design of sequence-controlled high intrinsic thermal conductivity polymers" for additional details.
